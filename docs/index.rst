====================

Tahrir is `Arabic for Liberation
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahrir_Square>`_.

Tahrir is also a `Pyramid <http://www.pylonsproject.org/>`_ app for issuing
your own `Open Badges <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges>`_.

The name is total overkill.

You can see Tahrir deployed in production `here
